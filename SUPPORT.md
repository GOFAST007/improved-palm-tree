### Before Support

- Make sure your question is a valid Theme Issue and not a customization request
- Make sure you have read through the documentation and any ressources before asking support on how to accomplish a task
- Make sure to double check the theme FAQs.
- If you have customized your theme and now have an issue, back-track to make sure you didn't make a mistake. If you have made changes and can't find the issue, please provide us with your changelog.
- Almost 80% of the time we find that the solution to people's issues can be solved with a simple "Google Search". You might want to try that before seeking support. You might be able to fix the issue yourself much quicker than we can respond to your request.
- Make sure to state the name of the theme you are having issues with when requesting support.
